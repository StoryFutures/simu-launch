      - The first prompt will say "Allow USB debugging? This computer's RSA key fingerprint is:" and then a long set of characters. Here click the button labelled "Always allow". This may, but not always, prevent these from appearing in future ![image.png](assets/image_1656321820008_0.png){:height 289, :width 792}
      - The other will say "Allow access to data?". Here click "Allow". This prompt should appear every time. If it does not there may be errors ![image.png](assets/image_1656321879143_0.png){:height 430, :width 831}
    - Once accepted, the device should appear on the dashboard within 1 minute. If it does not appear, even after refreshing the page, something has gone wrong, check if all prior steps have been followed, or start from the beginning
