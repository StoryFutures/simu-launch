# Simu-Launch

## Install

To run this, you need to install all the dependencies in requirements.txt as follows:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

In PyCharm 2022.1 there is a dedicated FastAPI Configuration you an use, which fixes some issues we were encountering with port blocking on restart.

## local dev

Run the uvicorn command, which keeps the server running and refreshes it every time there is a change:

`uvicorn main:app --reload`

From then, it all should be working on the interface at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>

## Production (raspberry pi)

On a raspberry pi, to allow other devices besides the pi accessing the server, run the below. Note that the host 0.0.0.0 allows the server to be accessible to other devices

`uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000 --host "0.0.0.0"`

Find out the ip address of the raspberry pi, perhaps via this command:

`ifconfig wlan0 | grep inet | awk '{ print $2 }'`

To access the server from other devices, just enter this ip address into your browser

### Auto-loading on device start

`sudo nano/etc/systemd/system/simulaunch.service`

Save below contents into file (via Control+s then Control-q to quit)

```[Unit]
